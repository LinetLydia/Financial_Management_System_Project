    "## **1.1 Problem Statement**\n",
    "Individuals and small businesses often struggle to track their **income**, **expenses**, **savings**, and **budgets** in a structured and consistent way. Without a proper financial management system, it becomes difficult to understand where money is going, prevent overspending, or maintain healthy saving habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Financial Management System (FMS)** helps users organize financial data by storing **transactions**, **budgets**, **accounts**, **categories**, and **savings goals**.  \n",
    "This project focuses on designing and querying a simple relational database that supports essential financial management features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1.2 Objectives**\n",
    "The goal of this SQL project is to design a functional **Financial Management System database** and write SQL queries that enable users to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Track **income** and **expenses**  \n",
    "- View **account balances**  \n",
    "- Categorize transactions (e.g., groceries, rent, salary)  \n",
    "- Set and monitor **budgets**  \n",
    "- Track **savings goals**  \n",
    "- Analyse spending patterns over time  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **1.3 Key Questions to Answer Using SQL**\n",
    "The analysis will answer financial questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How much did the user spend this month?  \n",
    "- What are the top categories where money is going?  \n",
    "- What is the **total income vs total expense** for a given period?  \n",
    "- Which months had the highest savings?  \n",
    "- How close is the user to meeting their savings goals?  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **1.4 Project Scope**\n",
    "This SQL project will involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Designing the database schema using **ERD principles**  \n",
    "- Creating database tables in SQL  \n",
    "- Inserting sample data  \n",
    "- Running analytical SQL queries  \n",
    "- Creating **views** for simplified reporting  \n",
    "- Documenting insights and conclusions  \n",
    "\n"
